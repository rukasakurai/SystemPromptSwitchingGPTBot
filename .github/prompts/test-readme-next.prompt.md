# Test README.next.md

Test #file:README.next.md by following the steps.

If any step doesn't have enough specificity, then it's ok to make your own judgement, but do not do anything that is not aligned with #file:README.next.md

If you see an issue with #file:README.next.md then fix it. Not enough specificity is not an issue. An issue is when something is wrong.
